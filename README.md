# **Facial Emotion Recognition** 😃😢😡  

This repository contains **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)** models trained on the **FER** and **AffectNet** datasets using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. Additionally, it includes experiments with a **pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT)** for facial expression recognition. Real-time emotion detection scripts using a webcam are also provided.

## **🚀 Features**  

✅ **CNN-based Emotion Recognition**  
- Trained on **FER** and **AffectNet** datasets.  
- Evaluated prediction accuracy for each dataset.  
- Training scripts and datasets included.  

✅ **ViT Transformer-based Recognition**  
- Used the **pretrained ViT model** from Hugging Face:  
  [ViT-Facial-Expression-Recognition](https://huggingface.co/motheecreator/vit-Facial-Expression-Recognition)  
- Evaluated performance on **FER** and **AffectNet** datasets.  

✅ **Real-time Facial Expression Detection**  
- Implemented real-time webcam-based emotion recognition.  
- Uses **OpenCV** and a trained model for live inference.

## **📌 Getting Started**  

### **🔹 1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hassaanmk/Facial-Emotion-recognition.git
cd Facial-Emotion-recognition
```

### **🔹 2. Install Dependencies**  
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(If you don’t have a `requirements.txt`, you can manually install packages like `torch`, `torchvision`, `opencv-python`, `transformers`, and `numpy`.)*  

### **🔹 3. Training CNN Models**  
Run training scripts inside the **FER training** or **AffectNet training** folders:  
```bash
python train.py
```

### **🔹 4. Running ViT Model on FER and AffectNet**  
Inside the `VIT Transformer` folder, run:  
```bash
python vit_evaluate.py
```

### **🔹 5. Real-time Facial Expression Detection**  
Run the webcam-based detection script:  
```bash
python webcam_test/webcam_detect.py
```
